In this blog post, we'll demystify multimodal AI models, explain their significance in the business world, and delve into the fascinating realm of GPT-4, a leading multimodal AI model by OpenAI.\\\\\\\\n What are Multimodal AI Models?\\\\\\\\nMultimodal AI models are advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating information from multiple data modalities or sources, such as text, images, audio, and video. Unlike traditional AI models, which are limited to processing only one type of data, multimodal models can analyze and generate insights from various data types, creating a more comprehensive understanding of the input data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/multimodality-tool-use-and-autonomous-agents/\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Simple \\\\\\\\u201cscaffolding\\\\\\\\u201d software can interpret the LLM\\\\\\\\u2019s text outputs as commands, and then execute them as appropriate.1\\\\\\\\nWhere an action would require logging into an account (e.g., to make a financial transaction), this can be completed via the human user stepping in, or via the LLM agent having pre-approval (e.g., having access to credentials or operating in a browser where the user is already logged in to relevant accounts). The promise of LLM agents lies in the hope that LLMs can be used to select and carry out actions in environments that are too complex or open-ended to represent formally, without needing large amounts of task-specific data to train a dedicated system \\\\\\\\u201cfrom scratch.\\\\\\\\u201d Researchers have developed open-source tools that map LLM outputs to clicks and keystrokes in a browser, and companies like OpenAI and Microsoft have equipped their models with web browsing capabilities that allow them to access websites and report back to the user about their contents.\\\\\\\\n Thanks to John Bansemer, Matt Burtell, Hanna Dohmen, James Dunham, Rachel Freedman, Krystal Jackson, Ben Murphy, and Vikram Venkatram for their feedback on this post.\\\\\\\\nMarch 8, 2024\\\\\\\\nFoundations\\\\\\\\nRelated Content\\\\\\\\nLarge language models (LLMs), the technology that powers generative artificial intelligence (AI) products like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, are often thought of as chatbots that predict the next word.
